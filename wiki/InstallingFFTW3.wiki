#summary A schematic overview of FFTW 3 installation.

=Unix=

The installation of [http://www.fftw.org FFTW 3] on any Unix system is straightforward and therefore is _highly recommended_, since it greatly improves the performance of *ADDA*. The easiest is to [http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Installation-on-Unix.html install FFTW 3 for the entire system], using `root` account.  However, it also can be installed under any user account as follows:
 * Download the [http://www.fftw.org/download.html latest version of FFTW 3] 
 * Unpack it, cd into its directory, and type
{{{
./configure --prefix=$HOME [--enable-sse2]
}}}
 where `'--enable'` option allows effective use of modern processors. You may also look through the [http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Installation-on-Unix.html whole list of configuration options]. Then type
{{{
make
make install
}}}
 * Modify the initialization of internal variables `FFTW3_INC_PATH` and `FFTW3_LIB_PATH` in the `Makefile`, as described in [CompilingADDA].

[http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Installation-on-non_002dUnix-systems.html Installation of FFTW 3 on non-Unix systems] is slightly more complicated. 

=Windows=
If you just want to use Windows executables included in the [PackageDescription ADDA package], do not worry about FFTW3 at all. An appropriate DLL is included in the package.

If you want to compile ADDA on Windows yourself, [http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html install FFTW3 on Windows]. Although building FFTW3 from source is possible, a recommended simpler way is to download a precompiled package (32 or 64-bit), containing DLLs and header files. Additionally, you need to modify the initialization of internal variables `FFTW3_INC_PATH` and `FFTW3_LIB_PATH` in the `Makefile` to point to the installation directory of FFTW3 (see [CompilingADDA]).

#summary Overview of ADDA OpenCL implementation and installation notes.

[http://www.khronos.org/opencl/ OpenCL] is a framework for programming highly
parallel devices like graphic cards (GPUs) and mutlicore CPUs. The
implementation is experimental and just works on high end Nvidia GPUs 
(Geforce GTX 260/Tesla C1060 and newer) at the present state. AMD GPUs will be suported soon.

= Setup of the environment =

On the Ubuntu Linux operating system, there is a PPA with the recent device drivers of AMD/Nvidia
{{{
ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates 
}}}
for details about handling PPAs just read the [https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA PPA help page].

== Nvida GPUs ==

The easiest way to set up a working OpenCL environment is to install a
recent [http://www.nvidia.com/page/drivers.html Nvidia device driver] and their [http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpucomputing.html GPU computing toolkit]. The latter is named "CUDA Toolkit" but it contains OpenCL components.

In the Ubuntu 10.10 operating system, the OpenCL environment should be already set up by just installing the Nvidia device driver from the repository.

== AMD GPUs ==

The [http://developer.amd.com/gpu/ATIStreamSDK/Pages/default.aspx AMD Stream-SDK] need to be installed and the _fglrx_ driver (the proprietary AMD driver) There are [http://forums.amd.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=390&threadid=125792 Debian packages] available to reduce the installation effort of OpenCL on Debian based Linux distributions.

= Implementation =

In general the whole matrix-vector multiplication is done on the GPU. It is currently in an early state and just tested on the Linux operating system.
For details and benchmarks see [http://www.iup.uni-bremen.de/iuppage/psa/documents/huntemann11.pdf the report of the OpenCL implementation]

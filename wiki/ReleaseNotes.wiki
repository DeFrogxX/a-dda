=Ver. 0.78.2 - 11.04.08=
 *  An implementation of a new FCD polarization prescription (`-pol fcd`) was somewhat faulty. Correction terms of orders (_kd_)^2^ and ln(...)(_kd_)^3^ were interchanged. Fixed.
 * Critical bug in `cDiv` and `cDivSelf` functions in source file [http://code.google.com/p/a-dda/source/browse/trunk/src/cmplx.h cmplx.h] was fixed (introduced in version 0.78). This bug made BiCGSTAB and BiCG iterative solvers to fail. Moreover, even when other two iterative solvers were used, erroneous results were calculated for certain values of refractive index.

=Ver. 0.78 - 19.03.08=
 * Name of MPI executable is now `adda_mpi`; this allows automatic compilation of both sequential and MPI versions from the same source folder.
 * Parallel executable for Win32, compiled with MPICH 2, is included in the package.
 * Filtered coupled dipoles formulation was implemented (both full and quasistatic version). New arguments `fcd` and `fcd_st` for interaction term (`-int` command line option) and `fcd` for polarization term (`-pol` command line option). It greatly improves DDA performance for large refractive indices.
 * To-do list added to the package: `doc/todo.xls` and `todo.pdf`.
 * Hands-on tutorial was added to the manual. It is based on the one carried out during the DDA Workshop in Bremen.
 * New command line option `'-opt {speed|mem}'` was added. It allows choosing whether *ADDA* will optimize itself for maximum speed or for minimum memory usage.
 * Calculation of scattered fields is accelerated by more than 4 times (compiled with `gcc`). Thanks to R. Scott Brock for this idea. This may also significantly accelerate orientation averaging, depending on the problem.
 * New command line option `'-eq_rad <arg>'` was added, it allows one to specify volume-equivalent radius of a scatterer.
 * Shapes `box` and `spherebox` no longer depend on the second and third argument of `-grid` option.
 * Shape `box` now accepts two optional arguments: y/x and z/x aspect ratios, defining a rectangular parallelepiped.
 * Automatic line wrapping was added for most output to stdout and stderr. *ADDA* tries to get terminal width from `COLUMNS` environmental variables and, if fails, uses the default value.
 * Two new shapes were added: `capsule` and `egg`. They were implemented by Daniel Hahn and Richard I. Joseph.
 * Now, if grid size is auto-initialized from default dpl, *ADDA* ensures that it is not smaller than 16.
 * Limitation on positiveness of dipole coordinates in shape file was removed. Now *ADDA* automatically determines the minimum box around the particle and centers it as usual.
 * Orientation averaging was optimized. If _?_ is varied in a full range [0ø,360ø), only one value of _?_ is simulated for _?_=0ø and 180ø, saving a few evaluations of internal fields. Thanks to Antti Penttila for this idea.
 * Limited two-way compatibility with DDSCAT 6.1 geometry format was added. ADDA automatically detects DDSCAT format during reading of dipole file. When saving geometry to the file, the format is determined by new command line option `'-sg_format {text|text_ext|ddscat}'`.
 * Several minor bugs were fixed.

=Ver. 0.77 - 05.06.07=
 * The bug was fixed that crashed the calculation of radiation forces.
 * Handling of large integers was improved throughout the program. Now it should work for any problem that fits into memory. Checks of integer overflow were added where necessary to avoid crashes.
 * Robustness of handling the command line and input files was improved.
 * Makefiles were improved, in particular, an option was added to use Intel compilers without static linking.
 * Command line option `-store_dip_pol` was added to save dipole polarizations to file.
 * The breakdown detection of the iterative solvers was improved. Now it should be much more sensitive. Thanks to Sorin Pulbere for reporting a test problem.
 * A minor bug in Romberg integration, reported by Antti Penttila, was fixed.
 * Locking of files was made more flexible. A compile option was added to independently turn off the advanced file locking.
 * Manual was significantly improved. "DDA formulation" section was rewritten to be self-contained, sections "Near-field" and "Comparison with other DDA codes" were added. Sections on compiling and running the code were extended to discuss in detail multi-core PCs. Sections "Applicability of DDA" and "System requirements" were extended to include recent benchmark results and discussion. Thanks to Vitezslav Karasek and Liviu Clime for their feedback.

=Ver. 0.76 - 14.10.06=

 * Makefiles modified to include Compaq compiler. New variables added to set path for FFTW3 header and library.
 * New option `-V` added to show version, compiler used, and copyright information.
 * Robustness of memory handling improved.
 * Timing is now produced even when `-prognose` option is used. Communication times are shown only in parallel mode, they are now more accurate.
 * All timing in parallel mode is now done through `MPI_Wtime`, which measures wall time.
 * Memory requirement in the manual are slightly corrected. The values produced by the program itself were correct.
 * New option `-granul` to granulate one of the domains.
 * Orientation averaging did not work in parallel (reported by Antti Penttila). Fixed.
 * Symmetries were not switched off by non-symmetric Gaussian beams. Fixed.
 * Computation of scattering of a tightly focused Gaussian beam was compared to multiple multipole method (data by Roman Schuh and Thomas Wriedt). Results of the comparison show perfect agreement.
 * New chapter in the manual to facilitate adding a new predefined shape.
 * New file `doc/faq` added for frequently asked questions.
 * New option `-store_beam` to save incident electric fields to a file.
 * Starting from this release *ADDA* executable for 32 bit Windows is available. It is compiled with MinGW and distributed with FFTW3 dynamic link libraries. Thanks to Alexander Shvalov for information on MinGW.
 * Added support for anisotropic refractive index (option `-anisotr`). Currently it is limited to refractive index tensors that are diagonal in the particle reference frame. Thanks to Michiel Min for fruitful discussions.

=Ver. 0.75 - 24.05.06=
 * All `'system'` calls were removed to improve robustness under certain MPI implementations.
 * Possible size of FFT-grid (and non-weird number of processors) has been extended to full range of FFTW. One possible divisor of either 11 or 13 has been added.
 * Robustness of makefiles with Intel compilers 8.1 and 9.0 in conjunction with MPICH has been increased.
 * Sample script for Sun Grid Engine has been added: `sample/test.sge`.
 * Different descriptions of Gaussian beam are now fully operational.
 * Origin is now always in the center of the computational box (before it was not so when _jagged_>1).
 * When incident field was used as an initial vector of the iterative solver, more iterations than necessary to reach epsilon were performed. Fixed.
 * Progress reported in the first iteration after checkpoint loading was incorrect in certain cases. To fix it required loss of checkpoint compatibility with earlier versions. More information is now displayed after checkpoint loading.
 * Robustness of generation of error messages in parallel mode has been increased.
 * Calculation of _C_,,sca,, or *g* caused both polarizations to be calculated even for particles that are symmetric for 90 degree rotation over the _z_-axis. That is not necessary - fixed.
 * Integration module has been significantly improved. It automatically uses the trapezoid rule for periodic function. Error estimates now seem to be reliable. Format of parameters for integration module has been changed because of the improvement.
 * www page of *ADDA* has been created.

=Ver. 0.74.2 - 05.04.06=
 * Makefiles has been improved to allow simple usage of Intel compilers.
 * A section describing FFTW 3 installation has been added to the manual.

=Ver. 0.74 - 29.03.06=
 * 'buggy' beam type has been removed (obsolete).
 * Command line options `-nosym` and `-sym_enf` has been combined into `'-sym {no|enf}'`.
 * Internal fields are now automatically collected into one file, when running in parallel mode (named `IntField-X` and `IntField-Y`)
 * MPI-specific command line options has been enabled.
 * Geometry filename given to the command line option -save_geom should now be specified relative to the output directory.
 * In parallel mode each processor (except root) produces a separate logfile, if any errors or warnings were detected (on this specific processor).
 * Overall robustness of the code is improved (added many consistency checks).
 * Help system has been added (new command line option `-h`).

=Ver. 0.73 - 02.03.06=
 * First stable release that has a manual and other documentation

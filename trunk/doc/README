                                1. INTRODUCTION
                                ***************

   ADDA is a C software package to calculate scattering and absorption of
electromagnetic waves by particles of arbitrary geometry using the Discrete
Dipole Approximation (DDA). In this approximation the volume of the scatterer
is divided into small cubical subvolumes ("dipoles"), interaction of which is
considered approximately based on the integral equation for the electric field.
Initially DDA (sometimes referred to as the "coupled dipole approximation") was
proposed replacing the scatterer by a set of point dipoles (hence the name of
the technique).

   ADDA is a C implementation of the DDA developed by the authors. The
development has been conducted by Hoekstra and coworkers for more than 10 years
at the University of Amsterdam. From the very beginning the code was intended to
run on a multiprocessor system (parallelizing a single DDA simulation). Recently
the code was significantly rewritten and improved by Yurkin. ADDA is intended to
be a versatile tool, suitable for a wide variety of applications ranging from
interstellar dust and atmospheric aerosols to biological particles; its
applicability is limited only by available computer resources. As provided, ADDA
should be usable for many applications without modification, but the program is
written in a modular form, so that modifications, if required, should be fairly
straightforward.

   Detailed instructions for using ADDA and all relevant issues are contained in
the User Manual for ADDA. The User Manual is in the file "manual.pdf" in PDF
format. It contains instructions for:
* compiling and linking the code;
* running a sample simulation;
* defining a scatterer and its orientation;
* specifying the type and propagation direction of the incident beam;
* specifying the DDA formulation;
* specifying what scattering quantities should be calculated;
* understanding the computational aspects and timing of the code;
* understanding the command line options and formats of input and output files.
* modifying the source code for added functionality


                                2. AVAILABILITY
                                ***************

   The authors make this code openly available to others, in the hope that
it will prove to be a useful tool.  We ask only that:

* If you publish results obtained using ADDA, you should acknowledge the source
  of the code. We recommend the following general reference:

  approximation for simulation of light scattering by particles much larger than
  the wavelength", J. Quant. Spectros. Radiat. Transf. 106, 546-557 (2007).

* If you discover any errors in the code, please promptly communicate them to
  the authors.

  you distribute copies of this software, you must give the recipients all the
  rights which you have.  See the file "copyleft" distributed with the ADDA
  software.

   We also strongly encourage you to send email to the authors identifying
yourself as a user of ADDA;  this will enable the authors to notify you of any
bugs, corrections, or improvements in ADDA.

                           ************************

   On Unix systems, while positioned in src/, type
  > make seq
or
  > make mpi
for sequential and MPI versions respectively. By default you need FFTW to be
installed (www.fftw.org) on your system.

                   Please read the User Manual (manual.pdf).

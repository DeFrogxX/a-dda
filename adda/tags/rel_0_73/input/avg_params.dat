# Description of the parameters for orientation averaging
#
# This file should be manually modified by user. 
# Program does not assume any symmetries of the particle.
# Therefore, possible symmetries should be considered by user and this can lead to
# decrease of integration limits 

alpha:
# calculation for alpha is cheap but only precalculated, therefore
# JMAX should be rather large
# K is actually how many interpolation points used
# eps is really not used
min=0
# default max=360
max=360
Jmax=5
K=5
eps=0
equiv=true

beta:
min=0
# default max=180
# xy - symmetry plane max=90
max=180
Jmax=4
K=4
eps=0
equiv=false

gamma:
min=0
# default max=360
# axysymmmetrical max=0
max=360
Jmax=4
K=4 
eps=0
equiv=true

# K is maximum number of interpolation points (except for alpha),
# interpolation starts with KMIN (defined in Romberg.h).

# equiv means whether it is assumed that max and min values 
# are completely equivalent. If true only one of them is calculated.

# Nmax = 2^(Jmax-1) + 1
# for those with equiv=true Nmax is effectively less by 1 
# total calls for single orientation <= Nmax_beta * Nmax_gamma

# axysymmetrical <=> particle with z - axis of symmetry

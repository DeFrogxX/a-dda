----------------------------------
Ver. 0.73 - 02.03.06

! first stable release that has a manual and other documentation

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.74 - 29.03.06

+ Slightly increased the speed for scattered field calculation.
+ User manual improved.
* 'buggy' beam type removed (obsolete).
* '-nosym' and '-sym_enf' options combined to '-sym {no|enf}'.
- In documentation there was option  '-pol ldr avg' while actually it was
  '-pol ldr avgpol'. It is averaging over incident polarizations 
  (not directions). Documentation corrected.
+ Internal fields are now automatically collected into one file, when running 
  in parallel mode ('IntField-X' and 'IntField-Y')
- Saving of geometry in parallel mode could produce incomplete results (parts
  of some processors could be lost). Fixed.
+ MPI-specific command line options are enabled. Before they could cause 
  segmentation fault.
* Geometry filename given to the command line option '-save_geom' is now 
  specified relative to the output directory (i.e. if no path is given, it is 
  saved into this directory).
+ Some warnings are now duplicated in the log.
+ In parallel mode each processor (except root) produces a separate logfile, if 
  any errors or warnings were detected (on this specific processor). These files 
  are named 'logerr.n' where n - is a number of processor.
* Minor changes to output format to stdout.
+ Added source files 'param.c/h'.
+ Overall robustness of the code is improved (added many consistency checks).
+ Help system added (new command line option -h).
- Fixed small bug in file locking (it could fail unexpectedly under certain 
  circumstances).

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.74.2 - 05.04.06

+ Makefiles are more robust now. Option of using Intel compiler added.
+ Release option added to Makefiles (turns on/of all warnings automatically).
- A number of minor inaccuracies in the code fixed.
+ Section describing FFTW 3 installation added to the manual.

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.75 - 24.05.06

- Small bug in logging of command line fixed.
- Function 'system' (more precisely everything that calls 'fork') could fail 
  unexpectedly under certain MPI implementations. All system calls removed.
+ Added source file 'os.h'.
+ Checking of errors in stdout has been added.
+ Possible size of FFT-grid (and non-weird number of processors) has been 
  extended to full range of FFTW. One possible divisor of either 11 or 13 
  has been added.
+ Increased robustness of makefiles with Intel compilers 8.1 and 9.0 in 
  conjunction with MPICH.
* Sample file 'batch' renamed to 'test.pbs' in 'sample/'.
+ Added sample script for SGE 'sample/test.sge'.
+ Different descriptions of Gaussian beam are now fully operational. Help, 
  references added. Evaluation of extinction crosssection is modified to be 
  compliant with Gaussian beams.
- Origin is now always in the center of the computational box (before it was 
  not so when jagged>1).
- When x_0=E_inc was used, more iterations than necessary to reach epsilon were 
  performed. Fixed.
* Progress reported in the first iteration after checkpoint loading was 
  incorrect in certain cases. To fix it required loss of checkpoint 
  compatibility (!!!) with earlier versions.  Some additional information is 
  shown after checkpoint loading.
- Sometimes in parallel mode program could die of some error before producing an
  error message. Fixed.
* Copyright statement changed in code description and output. Now it is with
  University of Amsterdam.    
+ Precision increased to 10 in ouput of several variables into log.
- Calculation of Csca or g caused both polarizations to be calculated even for
  particles that are symmetric for 90 degree rotation over the z-axis. That is
  not necessary - fixed.
+ Integration module significantly improved. It automatically uses trapezoid
  rule for periodic function. Error estimates now seem to be reliable.
* Format of parameters for integration module changed because of improvement.
  It affects parameter files alldir_params.dat, avg_params.dat, 
  scat_params.dat, making them incompatible with previous versions.
- Integration logs for Csca and g.x-g.z were saved in the same file for both
  incident polarizations. Now suffix "-X" or "-Y" is added to file names.

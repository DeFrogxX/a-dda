# all values are precalculated; so high 'eps' does not decrease computational time,
#   but may decrease accuracy
# K is maximum number of interpolation points
#   interpolation starts with KMIN (defined in Romberg.h).
# when equiv=true, it is assumed that max and min values 
#   are completely equivalent (together with values of cos/sin multipliers, when applicable). 
#   Only one of them is calculated. 
# Nmax = 2^(Jmax-1) [+1]
# axysymmetrical <=> particle with z - axis of symmetry

# parameters that are not needed are just ignored (can be omitted)

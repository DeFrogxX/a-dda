! first stable release that has a manual and other documentation

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.74 - 29.03.06

+ Slightly increased the speed for scattered field calculation.
+ User manual improved.
* 'buggy' beam type removed (obsolete).
* '-nosym' and '-sym_enf' options combined to '-sym {no|enf}'.
- In documentation there was option  '-pol ldr avg' while actually it was
  '-pol ldr avgpol'. It is averaging over incident polarizations 
  (not directions). Documentation corrected.
+ Internal fields are now automatically collected into one file, when running 
  in parallel mode ('IntField-X' and 'IntField-Y')
- Saving of geometry in parallel mode could produce incomplete results (parts
  of some processors could be lost). Fixed.
+ MPI-specific command line options are enabled. Before they could cause 
  segmentation fault.
* Geometry filename given to the command line option '-save_geom' is now 
  specified relative to the output directory (i.e. if no path is given, it is 
  saved into this directory).
+ Some warnings are now duplicated in the log.
+ In parallel mode each processor (except root) produces a separate logfile, if 
  any errors or warnings were detected (on this specific processor). These files 
  are named 'logerr.n' where n - is a number of processor.
* Minor changes to output format to stdout.
+ Added source files 'param.c/h'.
+ Overall robustness of the code is improved (added many consistency checks).
+ Help system added (new command line option -h).
- Fixed small bug in file locking (it could fail unexpectedly under certain 
  circumstances).

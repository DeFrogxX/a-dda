                	        ***************

   ADDA is a C software package to calculate scattering and absorption of 
electromagnetic waves by particles of arbitrary geometry using the Discrete 
Dipole Approximation (DDA). In this approximation the volume of the scatterer 
is divided into small cubical subvolumes ("dipoles"), interaction of which is
considered approximately based on the integral equation for the electric field.
Initially DDA (sometimes referred to as the "coupled dipole approximation") was
proposed replacing the scatterer by a set of point dipoles (hence the name of
the technique). 

   ADDA is a C implementation of the DDA developed by the authors. The
development was conducted by Hoekstra and coworkers for more than 10 years in
University of Amsterdam. From the very beginning the code was intended to run on
a multiprocessor system (parallelizing a single DDA simulation). Recently the
code was significantly rewritten and improved by Yurkin. ADDA is intended to be
a versatile tool, suitable for a wide variety of applications ranging from
interstellar dust and atmospheric aerosols to biological particles; its
applicability is limited only by available computer resources. As provided, ADDA
should be usable for many applications without modification, but the program is
written in a modular form, so that modifications, if required, should be fairly
straightforward. 

   Detailed instructions for using ADDA and all relevant issuse are contained in
the User Manual for ADDA. The User Manual is in the file "manual.pdf" in PDF 
format. It contains instructions for:
* compiling and linking the code;
* running a sample simulation;
* defining a scatterer and its orientation;
* specifying the type and propagation direction of the incident beam;
* specifying the DDA formulation;
* specifying what scattering quantities should be calculated;
* understanding the computational aspects and timing of the code;
* understanding the command line options and formats of input and output files.

                                ***************

   The authors make this code openly available to others, in the hope that
it will prove to be a useful tool.  We ask only that:

* If you publish results obtained using ADDA, please consider acknowledging the
  source of the code.

            	           4. COMPILING AND LINKING
            	           ************************

   On Unix systems, while positioned in src/, type 
  > make seq
or  
  > make mpi
for sequential and MPI versions respectively. By default you need FFTW to be 
installed (www.fftw.org) on your system.

                   Please read the User Manual (manual.pdf).

Q: I have found a bug in ADDA. What should I do?
A: 1) Make sure you are using the latest version of ADDA (check the ADDA
   homepage). If you have modified the code yourself, try the original release.
   2) Look at the list of known bugs at the ADDA homepage, maybe your bug is
   already known.
   3) Try to understand how exactly the bug occurs, write down the sequence of
   actions that lead to it.
   4) Please try to localize the bug, i.e. try to remove as much command line
   parameters as possible without removing the bug. Also try to use defautl
   versions of input files, that you have modified.
   5) Send the results of (3) and (4) to the authors, together with all input
   files and Makefiles that you have used for compilation. Do not forget to
   include all the relevant output files,  at least 'log'. Please also include
   a brief description of your operation system and hardware. We will try to
   fix the bug as soon as possible.

Q: I do not understand how to ...? I run ADDA and get strange output or
   something different from what I have expected. What should I do?
A: 1) Make sure you are using the latest version of ADDA (check the ADDA
   homepage). Read carefully the relevant parts of the manual.
   2) Check the FAQ section of ADDA homepage.
   3) If that does not help, you're encouraged to send your question to the
   authors. Please try to make your question as specific as possible. If your
   question is based on a particular run, provide all relevant input and output
   files, at least 'log'.

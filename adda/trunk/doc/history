[*] Changes

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.73 - 02.03.06

! first stable release that has a manual and other documentation

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.74 - 29.03.06

+ Slightly increased the speed for scattered field calculation.
+ User manual improved.
* 'buggy' beam type removed (obsolete).
* '-nosym' and '-sym_enf' options combined to '-sym {no|enf}'.
- In documentation there was option '-pol ldr avg' while actually it was
  '-pol ldr avgpol'. It is averaging over incident polarizations
  (not directions). Documentation corrected.
+ Internal fields are now automatically collected into one file, when running
  in parallel mode ('IntField-X' and 'IntField-Y')
- Saving of geometry in parallel mode could produce incomplete results (parts
  of some processors could be lost). Fixed.
+ MPI-specific command line options are enabled. Before they could cause
  segmentation fault.
* Geometry filename given to the command line option '-save_geom' is now
  specified relative to the output directory (i.e. if no path is given, it is
  saved into this directory).
+ Some warnings are now duplicated in the log.
+ In parallel mode each processor (except root) produces a separate logfile, if
  any errors or warnings were detected (on this specific processor). These files
  are named 'logerr.n' where n - is a number of processor.
* Minor changes to output format to stdout.
+ Added source files 'param.c/h'.
+ Overall robustness of the code is improved (added many consistency checks).
+ Help system added (new command line option -h).
- Fixed small bug in file locking (it could fail unexpectedly under certain
  circumstances).

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.74.2 - 05.04.06

+ Makefiles are more robust now. Option of using Intel compiler added.
+ Release option added to Makefiles (turns on/of all warnings automatically).
- A number of minor inaccuracies in the code fixed.
+ Section describing FFTW 3 installation added to the manual.

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.75 - 24.05.06

- Small bug in logging of command line fixed.
- Function 'system' (more precisely everything that calls 'fork') could fail
  unexpectedly under certain MPI implementations. All system calls removed.
+ Added source file 'os.h'.
+ Checking of errors in stdout has been added.
+ Possible size of FFT-grid (and non-weird number of processors) has been
  extended to full range of FFTW. One possible divisor of either 11 or 13
  has been added.
+ Increased robustness of makefiles with Intel compilers 8.1 and 9.0 in
  conjunction with MPICH.
* Sample file 'batch' renamed to 'test.pbs' in 'sample/'.
+ Added sample script for SGE 'sample/test.sge'.
+ Different descriptions of Gaussian beam are now fully operational. Help,
  references added. Evaluation of extinction crosssection is modified to be
  compliant with Gaussian beams.
- Origin is now always in the center of the computational box (before it was
  not so when jagged>1).
- When x_0=E_inc was used, more iterations than necessary to reach epsilon were
  performed. Fixed.
* Progress reported in the first iteration after checkpoint loading was
  incorrect in certain cases. To fix it required loss of checkpoint
  compatibility (!!!) with earlier versions.  Some additional information is
  shown after checkpoint loading.
- Sometimes in parallel mode program could die of some error before producing an
  error message. Fixed.
* Copyright statement changed in code description and output. Now it is with
  University of Amsterdam.
+ Precision increased to 10 in ouput of several variables into log.
- Calculation of Csca or g caused both polarizations to be calculated even for
  particles that are symmetric for 90 degree rotation over the z-axis. That is
  not necessary - fixed.
+ Integration module significantly improved. It automatically uses trapezoid
  rule for periodic function. Error estimates now seem to be reliable.
* Format of parameters for integration module changed because of improvement.
  It affects parameter files alldir_params.dat, avg_params.dat,
  scat_params.dat, making them incompatible with previous versions.
- Integration logs for Csca and g.x-g.z were saved in the same file for both
  incident polarizations. Now suffix "-X" or "-Y" is added to file names.
+ www page of ADDA is now available at
  http://www.science.uva.nl/research/scs/Software/adda/

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.76 - 14.10.06

+ Makefiles modified to include new compiler 'compaq'. New variables added to
  set path for FFTW3 header and library.
* Default dpl is now calculated based on the maximum absolute value among given
  refractive indices, not the first one. dpl=10*max(|m|)
- Removed requirement of full set of refractive indices to be given for multi-
  domain scatterers, if '-prognose' option is used. Produces information
  message when relevant.
+ Added information about distribution of occupied dipoles among different
  domains to the log file for multi-domain particles.
* GPL license changed to version 2 - file 'copyleft' replaced.
+ New option '-V' added to show version, compiler used, and copyright
  information. A head with information and copyright is no more shown at every
  run (redundant).
+ All memory allocation routines are now called by similar-typed macros - much
  more cleaner. Robustness of memory handling improved.
+ Timing is now produced also when '-prognose' option is used. Communication
  times are shown only in parallel mode. Redundant calls to calculate
  communication timing in sequential mode removed.
* All timing in parallel mode is now done through MPI_Wtime, which measures
  wall time. No more timer overflows in parallel runs. New header 'timing.h' for
  this task.
+ Function attributes moved from 'const.h' to new header 'function.h'. Just for
  convenience.
- Communication timing now measures exactly communication times (synchronization
  before some communications is added for that).
- Memory requirement in the manual slightly corrected. The values produced by
  the program itself were correct.
+ New option '-granul <vol_frac> <diam> [<dom_number>]' to granulate one of the
  domains. When this option is used '_gran' is added to shapename. Currently it
  may easily fail for volume fraction larger than 30-40%. Separate timing is
  produced for granule generator.
  Two files added - 'mt19937ar.c/h' - for a random generator (Mersenne Twister).
  The header file slightly modified from the original.
- Bug in checkpointer fixed. Was not portable to systems where size_t!=int.
+ Added check if file system does not support file locking; error output of file
  locking and file removal is now more informative (errno string is shown).
- Orientation averaging did not work in parallel (reported by Antti Penttila).
  Fixed.
- Symmetries were not switched off by non-symmetric Gaussian beams. Fixed.
  Improved hadling of symmetries.
+ Computation of scattering of a tightly focused Gaussian beam was compared to
  multiple multipole method (data by Roman Schuh and Thomas Wriedt). Perfect
  aggreement. Results of the comparison are added to the manual.
+ Added chapter to the manual to facilitate adding a new predefined shape.
+ New file 'doc/faq' added for frequently asked questions.
+ New option '-store_beam' to save incident electric fields to a file.
+ Starting from this release ADDA executable for WIN32 is available. It is
  compiled with MinGW, and distributed with FFTW3 dll. Thanks to Alexander
  Shvalov for information on MinGW.
- ADDA crashed when one of the given refractive indices was equal to one. Check
  for this was added, now error message is produced in this case.
+ Added support for anisotropic refractive index (option '-anisotr'). Currently
  it is limited to refractive index tensors that are diagonal in the particle
  reference frame. Thanks to Michiel Min for fruitful discussions.

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.77 - (05.06.07)

- Calculation of radiation forces gave segmentation fault. The bug was
  introduced in version 0.76. Fixed.
+ Improved handling of large integers throughout the program. 'size_t' type is
  used wherever possible, so it should work for any problem that would fit into
  memory. Checks of integer overflow where necessary to avoid crashes.
+ Improved handling of input parameters to check for possible very large
  numbers, etc. Overall robustness improved.
+ Added checks to indicate incompatibility of orientation averaging and
  checkpoints with some other features.
- Consistency check for coated sphere was inaccurate. Fixed.
- Lack of EOL in the end of the input files could cause crash, as well
  as EOL conversion in geometry files. Fixed.
+ Makefiles improved (overall clarity + more flexibility for MPI compiling),
  included option for intel compilers without use of static linking.
+ Command line option '-store_dip_pol' was added to save dipole polarizations
  to file.
- Computer name was not properly shown when running MPI version on Windows.
  Fixed.
+ Improved the code that detects breakdowns of iterative solvers. Now it should
  be much more sensitive. Thanks to Sorin Pulbere for reporting a test problem.
- A minor bug in Romberg integration for angles that are sampled uniformly
  in their cos values, if both min and max values are exactly equal to 90
  degrees. Reported by Antti Penttila. Fixed.
+ Locking of files made more flexible. Added compile option to independently
  turn off the advanced file locking.
- Minor change in comm.c to remove a warning.
+ Manual was significantly improved: "DDA formulation" section was rewritten to
  be self-contained, sections "Near-field" and "Comparison with other DDA codes"
  were added. Sections on compiling and running the code were extended to
  discuss in detail multi-core PCs. Sections "Applicability of DDA" and "System
  requirements" were extended to include recent benchmarking results and
  discussion. Thanks to Vitezslav Karasek and Liviu Clime for their feedback.

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.78 - (19.03.08)

* Makefiles were improved to enable automatic compilation of both sequential and
  MPI versions from the same source folder. Name of MPI executable is now
  adda_mpi.
+ New file parbas.h added. MPI version is now checked for conformity both during
  compilation and at runtime.
+ Parallel executable for Win32, compiled with MPICH 2, is included in the
  package.
+ sample/test.sge file was updated to run on DAS-3 cluster.
+ Added explicit description of the used notation for the Euler angles in the
  manual, source code, help system, and parameter file.
+ sample/test.pbs was slightly improved.
+ File sinint.c added to calculate sine and cosine integrals.
+ Function cEqual was added to cmplx.h, it replaces memcpy calls in many other
  files.
+ Filtered coupled dipoles implemented (both full and quasistatic version). New
  arguments 'fcd' and 'fcd_st' for interaction term ('-int' command line option)
  and 'fcd' for polarization term ('-pol' command line option).
+ To-do list added (both in xls and pdf format).
+ Hands-on tutorial was added to the manual. It is based on the one carried out
  during the DDA Workshop in Bremen.
- ADDA was crashing for certain incorrect parameters given with the -h command
  line option. Fixed.
+ A few explicit statements that angles are specified in degrees were added to
  the help and input files.
+ New command line option '-opt {speed|mem}' added. It allows to choose whether
  ADDA will optimize itself for maximum speed or for minimum memory usage.
+ Stability of complex arithmetics slightly improved.
+ Calculation of scattered fields is accelerated by more than 4 times (compiled
  with gcc). Thanks to R. Scott Brock for this idea. This may also significantly
  accelerate orientation averaging, depending on the problem. Intel compiler is
  now only 10-20% faster than gcc, for all parts of the code.
- Minor bug in symmetry initialization of shape 'spherebox' is fixed.
- Information messages, when no real dipoles were allocated to one of the
  processors, did not work. Fixed.
* Information messages ("INFO:...") are now given without references to source
  files, which looks simpler.
+ New command line option '-eq_rad <arg>' was added, it allows one to specify
  volume-equivalent radius.
* Format of shape definitions in 'make_particle.c' was slightly changed.
* Shapes 'box' and 'spherebox' no longer depend on the second and third argument
  of '-grid' option.
+ Shape 'box' now accepts two optional arguments (y/x and z/x aspect ratios)
  defining a rectangular parallelepiped.
+ Automatic line wrapping was added for most output to stdout and sderr. ADDA
  tries to get terminal width from COLUMNS environmental variables and, if
  fails, uses the default value.
* '-pedantic' option for gcc was removed from Makefile, since it gave warnings
  about long predefined strings.
- Shape 'line' was not working correcty in combination with '-jagged' or
  explicitely specified grid sizes along y- and z-axes. Fixed.
+ Two new shapes were added: capsule and egg. They were implemented by Daniel
  Hahn and Richard I. Joseph.
+ Description of predefined shapes in the manual was improved.
* Now, if grid size is auto-initialized from default dpl, ADDA ensures that it
  is not smaller than 16.
+ Limitation on positiveness of dipole coordinates in shape file was removed.
  Now ADDA automatically determines the minimum box around the particle and
  centers it as usual. It also ignores blank lines in the middle or in the end
  of shape file.
+ Orientation averaging was optimized. When beta=0 or 180, gamma angle is not
  relevant but only combinations alpha+-gamma. If alpha is varied in a full
  range [0,360), only one value of gamma for these specific beta values is
  calculated, saving a few evaluations of internal fields. Thanks to Antti
  Penttila for this idea.
+ Limited two-way compatibility with DDSCAT 6.1 geometry format was added,
  corresponding to its shape option FRMFIL and output of 'calltarget' utility.
  ADDA automatically detects DDSCAT format during reading of dipole file. When
  saving geometry to the file, the format is determined by new command line
  option '-sg_format {text|text_ext|ddscat}'.
+ New argument 'auto' was added to '-sym' command line option to correspond to
  the general rule that one of the possible arguments is the default one. No
  functionality is changed for other arguments.

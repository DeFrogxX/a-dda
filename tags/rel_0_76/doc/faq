Q: I have found a bug in ADDA. What should I do?
A: 1) Make sure you are using the latest version of ADDA (check the ADDA 
   homepage). If you have modified the code yourself, try the original release. 
   2) Look at the list of known bugs at the ADDA homepage, maybe your bug is
   already known. 
   3) Try to understand how exactly the bug occurs, write down the sequence of
   actions that lead to it.  
   4) Please try to localize the bug, i.e. try to remove as much command line
   parameters as possible without removing the bug. Also try to use defautl 
   versions of input files, that you have modified.
   5) Send the results of (3) and (4) to the authors, together with all input
   files and Makefiles that you have used for compilation. Please also include
   a brief description of your operation system and hardware. We will try to
   fix the bug as soon as possible.

This list is far from being complete. Please send your questions to 
adda@science.uva.nl

# Description of the coverage of the whole solid angle for integration 
#
# This file should be manually modified by user. 
# Program does not assume any symmetries of the particle.
# Therefore, possible symmetries should be considered by user and this can lead to
# decrease of integration limits 

theta:
min=0
# default max=180
# xy - symmetry plane max=90
max=180
JMAX=6
K=6
eps=0
equiv=false

phi:
min=0
# default max=360
# axysymmmetrical max=0; JMAX=1;
max=360
JMAX=6
K=6 
eps=0
equiv=true

# all values are precalculated; so high 'eps' does not decrease computational time,
# but may decrease accuracy

# K is maximum number of interpolation points
# interpolation starts with KMIN (defined in Romberg.h).

# equiv means whether it is assumed that max and min values 
# are completely equivalent. If true only one of them is calculated.

# Nmax = 2^(JMAX-1) + 1
# for those with equiv=true Nmax is effectively less by 1 
# total calls of calc_field <= Nmax_theta * Nmax_phi

# axysymmetrical <=> particle with z - axis of symmetry
